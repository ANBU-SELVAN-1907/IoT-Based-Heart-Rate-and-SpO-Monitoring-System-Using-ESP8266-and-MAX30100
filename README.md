# IoT-Based-Heart-Rate-and-SpO-Monitoring-System-Using-ESP8266-and-MAX30100
his project presents an IoT-based health monitoring system that uses the MAX30100 pulse oximeter sensor to measure a user's heart rate and SpOâ‚‚ (oxygen saturation) levels. The data is collected by an ESP8266 NodeMCU, transmitted to a Firebase Realtime Database, and visualized on a lightweight Flask-based web dashboard
